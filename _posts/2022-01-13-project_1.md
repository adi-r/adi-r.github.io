## INTRO
This dashboard is designed to display ridership data in a simple and intuitive manner. Users can view the ridership data in three metro stations: UIC-Halsted, O'Hare Airport and Racine. 

The project was developed in R using RStudio as the development enviroment and ShinyApps to deploy the dashboard. The dashboard was designed with the intent of running on a touch-screen wall with a resolution of 5,760 x 3,240.

## PRE-PROCESSING
