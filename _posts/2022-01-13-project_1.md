## INTRO
This dashboard is designed to display ridership data in a simple and intuitive manner. Users can view the ridership data in three metro stations: UIC-Halsted, O'Hare Airport and Racine. 

The project was developed in R using RStudio as the development enviroment and ShinyApps to deploy the dashboard. The dashboard was designed with the intent of running on a touch-screen wall with a resolution of 5,760 x 3,240.

## PREREQUISITES
Installation of R and RStudio is necessary to run the application.
For this project we'll be using a couple of libraries that can be installed using 'install.packages()'
```
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("DT")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("scales")
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("shinydashboard")
library(lubridate)
library(DT)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
```
## PRE-PROCESSING
The data is sourced from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f/data).
The dataset is Tab Separated Value(.tsv) file, consisting of 1.08 million rows of data and contains the following attributes:

| Column |  |Data Type |
| :-----|  |:------  |
| station_id |  |integer |
| stationname |  |string |
| date |  |Date |
| daytype |  |character |
| rides |  |integer |

We first read the data file into the R file as a data frame(cta_station) for manipulating the attributes. We then check for NULL values in the dataset.
```
ok <- complete.cases(cta_station)
dim(cta_station[ok, ]) == dim(cta_station)
