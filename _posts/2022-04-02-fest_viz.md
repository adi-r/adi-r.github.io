## INTRO
![Main Page](\img\posts\fest_viz\main intro.PNG)
This dashboard displays data regarding the 4 biggest music festivals held in the US: Coachella, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits. 

Users can get an idea of the different acts performed in each of the festivals as well as the change in genres throughout the years, analyze the artisit lineup in detail for each festival, get a deeper understanding of some of the most famous artists who've performed at the festivals and finally see the timeline change in genres as well as the percentage of acts that make up the genre in each festival.

The data collected is from the years 1999 to 2015. The data comprises of different bands and the genres they represent, and the years played in diffferent festivals.

## THE DASHBOARD
The dashboard consists of four sections, each corresponding to a different visualizations that focuses on a certain aspect of the festival. 

#### EXPLORE TRENDS

The 'Explore Trends' section allows users to discover the various trends in genre that occur in each individual festival or in all the festivals as a whole. 

The graph in the centre displays the genre trend over time with each line corresponding to a specific genre and the points in the line denote the number of times Last.fm users have listened to songs by artists in that genre(ie. the playcount). 

Users can filter the graph by either clicking on the line to filter the genre or by selecting the genre from the menu on the left side.

Users can change the view of the graph by selecting the festival whose data the user wishes to analyze. The default option seems to be 'All' wich shows the overall genre trend in all of the festivals but users can drill down into each individual festival to find out more details.

Users can also view data on the various artisits who've performed at the festivals. The table shows the artist name followed by the number of times they're played in each festival. Each individual festival is denoted by a different colored musical note and the size of the musical note conveys the number of times the artist has played at the festival. Users also have the option of viewing data for a particular band by searching for it in the drop-down menu.

###### WHAT WORKS

* The visualization is clearly divided into two halves with the left half displaying data regarding the changes in trends over time and the right half showing tabular information on various artists along with the frequency of attendance. This split makes it easy for users to understand and explore the visualization in dpeth

* Multiple points of interactivity present allowing for greater user exploration. The trends on the graph are easily highlighted by clicking on them. Users can also highlight artists in the table which displays a pop-up showing a second graph that displays when artists have perfomred at festivals through time

* The size of musical notes in the table easily conveys the difference in number of times an artist has performed at the festival. The color-coding of the notes makes it easy to distinguish between the various festivals

* The different genres are color-coded making it easier to identify on the graph

* Graph is annotated at certain points showcasing different important events that have occurred throughout the timeline allowing for the user to get a better understanding of the bigger picture.

###### WHAT DOESN'T WORK

* The annotations filter doesn't work. Regardless of option selected, the annotations are still displayed on the graph and cannot be removed.

* While the size of the musical note conveys the number of times the artist has performed at a festival, there's no legend that explains at what range the size of the note changes. 

* The search bar allows users to scroll through varius artists and highlight the information they wish to see. But the large number of entries in the drop-down menu makes it difficult to search for a specific artist. 

* The large number of genres makes the bottom half of the graph appear cluttered

* The list of currently applied filters is not shown to the user. 

###### SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT

* The option to select/de-select genres allowing users to view information on only the genres they've selected. This will not only allow for easier exploration of data but can alo help to de-clutter the graph

* Show a list of currently applied filters allowing for users to keep track of the changes made to the visualization. Add a reset button to remove all filters added

* The option to type and search for specific bands in the table which improves efficiency of searching 

* The ability to filter both graph and table by genre. Currently they both exist as independent components but allowing users to filter the table by genre allows for greater analysis of data as users can observe the various artists associates with each genre increasing the dimensionality of inforamtion gained from the visualization.

#### POSTER COLLECTION - LINEUP DETAIL

Users can view data on the various lineups present in each festival in a specific year. 

This section is divided into four sections.

Users can select a poster from the given thumbnails categorized by year to show information regarding a specific festival. 

Users can also click on the year to get overall inforamtion on all the festivals in that year, the overall number of artists who've performed and the genres they represent.

Users can search for specific artists by scrolling through the drop-down menu. Selecting a specific artist displays the posters of the events they've played at along with the years in which they played.

Users can also see the breakdown of genre as a stacked bar. The genres are color-coded and display the percentage of artists associated with the genre for that specific year or festival. The bar also acts as a filter. Upon clicking a specific genre, users can view a bubble chart displaying the various artists in that genre in that particular year or event.

The bubble chart displays information on various artists. Hovering over a bubble displays the verious sub-genres that an artist falls under while clicking on a bubble displays posters of the festivals the artist has performed at along with the year.

The table shows information on artists, the total number of listeners on Last.fm and the total playcount up till the latest timeline present in the data. 

###### WHAT WORKS

* The ability to filter by year is great for users to view overall information for that particular year. Users can see the overall makeup of artists and the genres they represent

* The option to filter artists by genre is great for users to explore the various acts associated with the genre

* Multiple points of interactivity. Users can filter artist performances either through the drop-down menu or by clicking on the cooresponding bubble in the bubble chart. 

###### WHAT DOESN'T WORK

* The bubble chart gives no clear explanation regarding size of the bubbles. 

* It's tedious and inefficient to scroll through the artist list and find the required entry

* The table in the graph displays the latest listener and play count for that particular artist. But this information is not conveyed to the user. At first glance it may appear that the information in table corresponds to the selected year, when infact the table is static. 

* No option to reset filters. After application of filters, there's no option to reset filters to show visualization in it's default state. Users have to either click on a blank space within the visualization to reset it (this is far from intuitive) or refresh the entir webpage.
