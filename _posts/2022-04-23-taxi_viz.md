The dashboard can be accessed from [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](http://shiny.evl.uic.edu:3838/g10/adi_ranga_byt/).

## INTRO
This dashboard is designed to display taxi ridership data in a simple and intuitive manner. Users can search for ridership data by filtering the data based on the various options given in the dashboard such as filtering by taxi company and/or community area, viewing the data in kilometres or miles, in 12 hour or 24 hour format, and the rides going to/from a location. Users can observe the changes happening in the map, table and bar graph according to the filters applied. Users can view the different bar graphs from the drop down menu in the interface. Users can observe data on hourly, daily, weekly and monthly taxi rides along with the binned mileage and binned trip time graphs as well as the percentage of rides going to/from a community area. Users can observe these multiple graphs, analyze patterns that they can find in the data and draw their own inferences based on the data displayed by the interface.  

The project was developed in R using RStudio as the development enviroment and ShinyApps to deploy the dashboard. The dashboard was designed with the intent of running on a touch-screen wall with a resolution of 11,520 x 3,240.

## PRE-PROCESSING
The dataset is one Tab Separated Value(.tsv) file consisting of 16.5 million rows and 23 columns, but for the purposes of our project, we will only focus on 6 columns that contain the following attributes:

Ridership Dataset

| Column |  |Data Type |
| :-----|  |:------  |
| Trip Start Timestamp |  | string |
| Trip Seconds |  | int |
| Trip Miles |  | float |
| Dropoff Community Area |  | integer |
| Pickup Community Area |  | integer |
| Company |  | string |

We first read the ridership data file into the R file as a data frame(taxi_data) for manipulating the attributes. We rename the columns in the dataset for easier management of data
```
taxi_data <- taxi_data %>%
  rename(timestamp = `Trip Start Timestamp`,
         sec = `Trip Seconds`,
         miles = `Trip Miles`,
         pickup = `Pickup Community Area`,
         dropoff = `Dropoff Community Area`,
         company = `Company`)
```

We then check for NULL values in the dataset columns.
```
lapply(taxi_data,
       function(x) { 
         length(which(is.na(x)))
         }
       )
```

We can observe that NULL values appear in the columns of Pickup and Dropoff Community Area. As per our understanding, the NULL values here refer to community areas outside of Chicago. We will impute 0 (zero) in place of NULL.
```
taxi_data$pickup[is.na(taxi_data$pickup)] <- 0
taxi_data$dropoff[is.na(taxi_data$dropoff)] <- 0 
```

As per our project requirements, we can cut down on some of the data points by filtering the data based on the given conditions.
We can remove all taxi trips less than 0.5 miles and more than 100 miles
```
taxi_data <- filter(taxi_data, miles > 0.5 & miles < 100)
```
Similarly, we can remove all taxi trips less than 60 seconds and more than 5 hours
```
taxi_data <- filter(taxi_data, miles > 0.5 & miles < 100)
```

From the company column, we can clean up the string data in order to make the names more presentable
Remove all non-alphabetical characters from the data
```
taxi_data$company <- str_replace_all(taxi_data$company, "[^[:alpha:]]", " ")
```
Remove leading and trailing spaces in each new word
```
taxi_data$company <- trimws(taxi_data$company, which = c("both"))
```

We'll have to manually change some of the company names to ensure no data is lost
```
taxi_data <- taxi_data %>%
  mutate(company = recode(company, `Medallion Management Corp` = '312 Medallion Management Corp', 
                          `Star Taxi` = 'Five Star Taxi', 
                          `Seven Taxi` =  'Twentyfour Seven Taxi', 
                          `Star Taxi` = 'STAR Taxi',
                          `Sun Taxi` = 'SUN Taxi',
                          `Checker Taxi Affiliation` = 'CHECKER Taxi Affiliation',
                          `Chicago Taxicab` = 'CHICAGO Taxicab'
                          ))
```
We'll create a unique code for each individual taxi company. The idea being that numbers use less memory resource and process faster.
```
taxi_data$company_code <- as.integer(factor(taxi_data$company))
```

We'll create a new dataframe that holds just the company name and the corresponding company code and output the dataframe to a .csv file
```
companies <- distinct(taxi_data, company_code, .keep_all = TRUE)
companies <- companies[, c("company", "company_code")]
write.csv(companies,"C:/Users/aranga22/Downloads/Academics/Sem 2/424 Visual Data/Projects/424_Project3/ext\\companies.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
Similarly, manually create a csv file that holds the community area name and the community code. This can be done by copying values from the table given in[<span style="color:blue">Wikipedia</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago)


Let's deal with the timestamp data. We'll first convert the timestamp to POSIX format and then extract the individual day, month, year, hour components from it.
```
taxi_data <- taxi_data %>%
  mutate(timestamp = mdy_hms(timestamp))


taxi_data <- taxi_data %>%
  mutate(year = year(timestamp),
         month = month(timestamp),
         day = day(timestamp),
         hour = hour(timestamp)
  )
```

We'll create a date column by concatenating the day, month, year values 
```
taxi_data$date <- with(taxi_data, ymd(paste(year, month, day, sep= ' ')))
```

Get the weekday name and month name data from the corresponding columns
```
# Create week day column
taxi_data$week_day <- lubridate::wday(taxi_data$timestamp, label=TRUE)

name_of_month <- function(taxi_data){
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==1] <- 'Jan'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==2] <- 'Feb'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==3] <- 'Mar'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==4] <- 'Apr'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==5] <- 'May'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==6] <- 'Jun'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==7] <- 'Jul'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==8] <- 'Aug'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==9] <- 'Sep'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==10] <- 'Oct'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==11] <- 'Nov'
  taxi_data$month_name[taxi_data$month==12] <- 'Dec'

  return(taxi_data)

}
taxi_data <- name_of_month(taxi_data)
```

We remove all unnecessary columns from our dataframe and output the dataset into chunks to handle the restrictions on file size and for easier reading and manipulation of data.
```
taxi_data <- subset(taxi_data, select = -c(timestamp, year, month, day, company))

no_of_chunks <- 50
f <- ceiling(1:nrow(taxi_data) / nrow(taxi_data) * 35)
res <- split(taxi_data, f)
map2(res, paste0("part_", names(res), ".csv"), write.csv)
```
The output 'part_.csv' files will be the data source used for our application.

Users can optionally group data by different taxi companies and/or community areas and individually output each grouping into a .csv or .tsv file as well. using the same code above  

These are the data files we'll be using for our dashboard. 

## THE DASHBOARD
![Dashboard Interface](\img\posts\taxi_viz\dashboard.png)

The dashboard is divided into 4 components:

#### SIDEBAR
![sidebar](\img\posts\taxi_viz\filters.PNG)

Users can filter the data being observed by adjusting the filters on the sidebar. Users can choose to see the data in different metrics such as in kilometres/miles or in 12 hour/24 hour format. Users can choose to drill down the dataset by selecting a specific community and/or taxi company or they can choose to view the data data dor all taxi companies and/or communities. Users can choose whether to see the rides coming from/to a community.

Finally users can choose whether to exclude or include community areas outside of Chicago in the dataset or not. By choosing to include or exclude the dataset, all of the data is re-processed according to the selection made and the changes are reflected in the graphs and tables.


#### MAP
![Map](\img\posts\taxi_viz\map.PNG)

Users can pan around the map of Chicago, zoom in or out and view data of the various communities and the percentage of taxi rides going to/from that community. Selecting a community from the side panel calibrates the map to that communty location with a pop-up showing information on the community such as the name of the community and percentage of rides that are going to/from that community. Similarly, we can further drill-down on this data by filtering taxis by the taxi company to see percentage of taxis from a taxi company that go from/to a particular community

#### BAR GRAPH 

There are 7 different bar graphs for users to observe patterns in the data

###### DAILY GRAPH
![Daily Plot](\img\posts\taxi_viz\daily.PNG)

Users can see the daily ridership in the various communities in Chicago. Users can filter the data from the side panel by selecting a particular community and taxi company and observe the number of rides that occur daily for that community and taxi company. The bar graph and table change to reflect the values on that date. 

Users can easily mix-match different communities and taxi companies to find different patterns in the data and draw resonable inferences from them.

#### TABLES
![Table](\img\posts\taxi_viz\table.PNG)

Users can observe the same data seen on the graph in tabular form. Each bar graph has a table corresponding to it where users can sort the table columns in ascending/ descending as well as search for a particular entry in the table.

## INTERESTING INSIGHTS

By observing the data, we can observe some interesting insights. 

![norwood](\img\posts\taxi_viz\norwood247.PNG)
Looking into 24/7 Taxi Company, we see that the company has had a huge drop in taxi rides in Norwood and many other communities as well. By looking into these dates, we notice that there were reports of severe snowstorms which might have prompted cab drivers to stay indoors while also factoring in the decrease in number of outgoing passengers.  

![nova](\img\posts\taxi_viz\novataxi_april.PNG)
We observe the same dips in the Nova Taxi Affiliation LLC where there are huge drops in ridership in April which can again be attributed the reports of snowstorms and rainfall at the time.


## NEXT STEPS
Users can access the [<span style="color:blue">source code</span>](https://github.com/adi-r/424_Project3) if they wish to dive deep into the program and come up with their plots that they wish to visualize. Users can modify the selection of communities and taxi companies and choose their own filters to visualize and infer data from.
